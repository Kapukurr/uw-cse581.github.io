    "title": "Discussion Roles",
    "content": "Here are some roles you may use to guide your reading responses. As a discussion lead, you may ask students to address one or more of these perspectives in class.   Reporter . You work for a large newspaper, the Allen School Times, for which you regularly report on societal implications of technology. Prepare a very brief summary (1-2 sentences) of the main take-aways of each paper you are covering. Don’t just report on what the paper describes, but what its implications are. Next, run a background check on one of the paper’s authors. Where have they worked? What did they study? What previous projects might have led to working on this one? Finally, prepare 4-5 questions about the paper(s) that will steer class discussions. Use the responses of others on Canvas to inform at least some of these questions.   Press Intern . You are an intern for the Allen School Times where you are asked to support efforts to report on societal implications of technology. You are given a paper or article for which you must determine where it sits in the context of previous and subsequent societal issues. Find and report on a related paper (or news article) that has uncovered a related ethical issue. Like every good intern knows, one way to do this is to look at papers that cite this current work.   CEO . You work at a company or organization developing an application or product that is discussed in one of the papers we’re reading this week. Engaging in your best ethics washing and theatre, suggest changes to the product that pay lip service to ethics but do not actually address the issue at hand. Also be sure to convince your investors and employees that your company hasn’t really done anything wrong.   Utilitarian Tech Employee . You are a tech employee with a strong belief in Rule Utilitarianism, Prepare a convincing statement to your company leadership that lays out how a technology described in one of the papers we’re reading this week should change or not change.   Kantianism Activist . You are an activist who believes that following Kantianism will rescue our society from the problems of big tech. Prepare a short statement to convince the management of a tech company of specific actions they should take in relation to one or multiple products they are developing or owning. Your statement should be related to a technology or topic in the papers we’re reading this week.   Social Contract Theory Supporter . You are a friend of the tech employee (the one who believes in Rule Utalitarianism). Over dinner, you try to convince your friend to talk to his company’s leadership to change their behavior to be more in line with social contract theory. Prepare a short statement that is related to a technology or topic in the papers we’re reading this week.   Cultural Relativist . As a friend of the CEO and a strong believer in cultural relativism, you are discussing with the CEO how a given class subject and/or technology may be seen differently by people in other countries and cultures. Pick 1-2 other countries and research what their national culture may say about their values. Alternatively, you can also pick a culture within the US, a subculture of another country, or a broader cultural tendency (for example, individualism vs. collectivism) and analyze how the subject and/or technology may be seen differently by this group of people. Prepare a short statement that would convince the CEO to reconsider prior decisions. ",

As researchers of technology, data scientists, and software developers, we must be aware of the effects that technology has on society and recognize our responsibility to grapple with computer ethics. In this seminar course, we will discuss the goals of ethics, philosophical approaches to ethics, our own responsibilities, and the many kinds of ethical issues that impact technology and society today. Students will also learn different approaches to anticipating unintended consequences of technology. In a quarter-long research project, they will use these perspectives and approaches to discuss and address issues of applied technologies in areas such as artificial intelligence, user interface design, facial recognition, misinformation, accessibility, and privacy.

Most lectures will be structured the following way: . | ~40 minutes of paper discussions, led by a discussion lead | ~40 minutes of one of the following: . | an in-class activity (e.g., applying a framework for anticipating unintended consequences of technology to a specific product); | A talk by an invited speaker | Idea and project fairs (each team presents their projects) | Peer-feedback sessions on class projects | . | .

    "content": "As part of this class, you will be required to produce a preliminary research paper on the topic of computer ethics and present your research for a poster presentation. These research projects will be conducted in groups of 3-4 students and can be in your general area of interest or in one of the areas that we are covering in class. You will be required to discuss your project idea with the class, and make adjustments as necessary. Your project can address various topics in computer ethics, and be focused on various disciplines within CS and related fields, but it should fall into one or more of the following categories (these are action possibilities listed in the book Data Feminism by D’Ignazio and Klein): . | Collect: Compiling counter data (to add to existing data that may have “holes”) | Analyze: Demonstrate inequitable outcomes across groups | Imagine: Imagine the end-point not as “fairness”, but as co-liberation | Teach: How might we engage and empower newcomers to the field of computer ethics, including practitioners and researchers? | . My expectation for this research project is that it significantly extends previous findings in an area within CS. Your research project should be a plausible attempt at contributing a novel result. The final write-up should have the quality of a publishable paper, with the contribution being roughly that of a short paper (e.g., a workshop paper). The papers should be 4-6 pages long. This might sound short, but it’s much more difficult to write a concise and coherent story than it is to have unlimited space. Try to make one argument per sentence, and use one paragraph to zoom in on one argument. Use a template, i.e., find a paper that you particularly like and use it as a guideline on how to structure and write your own. ",

To keep the discussion going, read all reading responses by the other students and integrate them into the discussion.

If truly necessary, you can quote published work, but quotations must be clearly marked and properly attributed. You may obtain copy editing assistance, and you may discuss your ideas with others — but all substantive writing and ideas must be your own or else be explicitly attributed to another, using a citation. The exact form of the citation is not important; what matters is that you provide sufficient detail for someone else to easily relocate your source, even years later (so URLs alone are insufficient). All cases of plagiarism will be reported immediately. There will be no warnings, no second chances, no opportunity to rewrite.
