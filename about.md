## Pre-requisites and who this course is for

There are no pre-requisites for this class. While the course is designed for UW CSE graduate students (in any area of CS research), I welcome any UW graduate student in related fields. Basically, if you produce and use data, develop technology, and are part of our society, then this course is for you.
