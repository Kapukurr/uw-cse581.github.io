This syllabus was inspired by many other ethics classes offered at the UW and elsewhere, including Jared Moore and Dan Grossman’s [CSE492e](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse492e/20au/) (UW), Casey Fiesler’s [INFO 4601](https://informationethicspolicy.wordpress.com/) (UC Boulder), Amy Bruckman’s [CS 4863](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~asb/teaching/4863/fall2019/) (Georgia Tech), Joi Ito and Jonathan Zittrain’s [MAS.S64](https://www.media.mit.edu/courses/the-ethics-and-governance-of-artificial-intelligence/) (MIT). Thanks to Jared Moore and Dan Grossman for sharing materials and thoughts on this class!
