**Course Description:** In this seminar course, we will discuss the goals of ethics, philosophical approaches to ethics, our own responsibilities, and the many kinds of ethical issues that impact technology and society today. Students will also learn different approaches to anticipating unintended consequences of technology. In a quarter-long research project, they will use these perspectives and approaches to discuss and address issues of applied technologies in areas such as artificial intelligence, user interface design, facial recognition, misinformation, accessibility, and privacy.
