# Reading Responses

## Overview

For each class, I expect you to write a reading response for the assigned readings (with the exception of classes that are marked with an asterisk). There is a total of 13 reading responses and you may pass on 3 of them for any personal or family matters, or if you have conflicting deadlines. There are no exceptions beyond this. 

The reading responses are due at **6pm on the day before each class** (to give the discussion lead some time to read through them), submitted via [canvas]  (https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1512970) in the Discussion section.  Students in the role of a Reporter (aka discussion leader) do not have to submit a reading response that week because they will be presenting.  

## Format of Reading Responses
The goal of these reading responses is not to summarize the papers (keep in mind that everyone else will have already read the paper!), but to critically evaluate the content. For each class, you will provide a paragraph (5-10 sentences) in your own words about the papers, following one of three options as outlined below. In your reading response, please take on [one of these roles](https://uw-cse599p.github.io/discussion_roles/) which you will also represent during discussion in class.

Please sign up for these roles in [this google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OFsnFdCWmfNH2_KaAchdIwk9wFVshqs3JxTu57-UuuI/edit#gid=0) (we will give you edit access at the start of the quarter).

**Note:** Not all papers are suitable for these roles. For some, you may have to think of a hypothetical scenario or technology and discuss the paper through that lens. Feel free to be creative in your take on these roles as we’re testing out this new approach this quarter :) 

When writing the reading responses, you have the following options: 
* Option 1: One paragraph that discusses all readings for that day in accordance with the role you were assigned to.  
* Option 2: One paragraph that mainly discusses one of the readings for that day in accordance with your role, but briefly connects it to the other readings of that day. 
* Option 3: A single paragraph in which you respond to someone else’s reading response from the same day. 


This obviously means that you will have to wait until someone else has provided a reading response, so it won’t work that everyone picks this option. 

As a general rule: When in doubt, **please ask me!** Send me an email and I will look at the response. 

Also as a general rule: The reading response is mainly there to help you remember the paper and to help the discussion leader summarize different views.



## Grading Responses

Reading responses will be graded on a check-minus/check/check-plus scale. (1, 2, and 3 points, respectively. 
0 points if the response is missing at the time of the deadline.) As noted above, you may pass on 3 out of the 13 reading responses. 

* 3 points = the reading response believably represents the role you were assigned to for that week, is 5-10 sentences in length, well-written, and thought-provoking (i.e., you got some ideas from it).
* 2 points = the reading response is not written to the role you were assigned to, is too short/long, or does not show that you have engaged with the paper. 
* 1 point = the reading response is lacking two or more of the above requirements.
* 0 points = no submission

The three options for reading responses mentioned above will be equally graded.
