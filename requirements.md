## Participation

You are expected to attend and actively participate in every class session. To make the most of this class and not disrupt others, I expect you to be on time and ready to discuss the readings. If you can't make it because of sickness or a family emergency or similar, please let me know before class. 

## Preparation

I expect you to be well-prepared for each class. This means that you thoroughly read all assigned readings, prepare a reading response, and spend time thinking about the paper. Ideally, you will read the paper a few days before the seminar, and review it again a day before, so that there is enough time to connect the ideas from this paper to other work.


## Reading Responses and Discussion

For each class, I expect you to write a reading response for the assigned readings (with the exception of classes that are marked with an asterisk). There is a total of 13 reading responses. The goal of these reading responses is not to summarize the papers (keep in mind that everyone else will have already read the paper!), but to critically evaluate the research presented in the papers. For each paper in the reading list, you will provide a short paragraph (5-10 sentences) in your own words, taking on [one of these roles](https://suchin.io/ethics599p/discussion-roles) (which you will also represent during discussion in class).


Please sign up for these roles in [this google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OFsnFdCWmfNH2_KaAchdIwk9wFVshqs3JxTu57-UuuI/edit#gid=0).

The reading responses are due at **6pm on the day before each class** (to give the discussion lead some time to read through them), submitted via canvas (in the Discussions section).  The Reporter (aka discussion leader) does not have to submit a reading response that week because they will be presenting.  


## Grading Responses

Reading responses will be graded on a check-minus/check/check-plus scale. (1, 2, and 3 points, respectively. 
0 points if the response is missing at the time of the deadline.) You may pass on 3 out of the 13 reading responses for any personal or family matters, or if you have conflicting deadlines. There are no exemptions beyond this. 

* 3 points = the reading response believably represents the role you were assigned to for that week, is 5-10 sentences in length, well-written, and thought-provoking (i.e., you got some ideas from it).
* 2 points = the reading response is not written to the role you were assigned to, is too short/long, or does not show that you have engaged with the paper. 
* 1 point = the reading response is lacking two or more of the above requirements.
* 0 points = no submission

The following reading responses will be equally graded:
* Option 1: One paragraph that discusses all readings for that day in accordance with the role you were assigned to.  
* Option 2: One paragraph that mainly discusses one of the readings for that day in accordance with your role, but briefly connects it to the other readings of that day. 
* Option 3: A single paragraph in which you respond to someone else’s reading response from the same day. 

This obviously means that you will have to wait until someone else has provided a reading response, so it won’t work that everyone picks this option. 

As a general rule: When in doubt, **please ask me!** Send me an email and I will look at the response. 

Also as a general rule: The reading response is mainly there to help you remember the paper and to help the discussion leader summarize different views.


## Leading Discussions

Each of you will serve as a discussion leader once during the term. For some classes, two students may be asked to lead the discussion together. Your responsibilities as a discussion leader are:

* Read and understand the papers for that class, along with any supporting material that you think would provide helpful background. Please also read the optional readings for that day, if any.

* Take on the role of a [reporter](https://uw-cse599p.github.io/discussion_roles/#reporter-aka-discussion-lead). This includes summarizing the key take-aways, running a background check on the authors, and preparing a few thought-provoking questions. 

* Prepare a 2-3 minute informal talk. I recommend no slides to maximize the time for discussion, but feel free to use them if you think it helps. Do not talk longer than 3 minutes! If you have more to say, you can integrate it in the discussion later (e.g., when the discussion dies down, you can bring up another fact you found). 

* Lead a ~30 minutes discussion after your talk. To keep the discussion going, read all reading responses by the other students and integrate them into the discussion. For each topic, you should prepare 4-5 discussion  questions about the papers or overall topic. These must not be trivial questions with easy answers, but creative, deeper questions that result from your attempts to understand the material, or its implications, or its connections with other work. The quality and originality of your questions will reflect your effort in thinking about the material.



## Grading

You should do good work in this class because you care about the project you picked, because you want to learn how to design effective online experiments, and because you want to advance research. That said, the university makes us use grades, so here is how I will assess your grades:

* 15% Reading responses
* 15% In-class contributions
* 10% Discussion lead
* 60% Research project and paper:
    * 5% Idea Fair
    * 7% Project Proposal (Abstract and Related Work section)
    * 8% Methods (or similar)
    * 15% Project Fair Round 1
    * 25% Project Fair Round 2 (including final project paper)


## Due dates and Late Policy

Since we will be discussing each of your milestones in class, all deliverables have to be submitted before 9 am on the morning of the class. I will not be able to grant any exceptions (unless there are personal or family  emergencies), so please make sure that you plan ahead if you have conflicting deadlines. 

Reading responses are due by 6pm on the day before class. Late reading responses will not be graded, but you are allowed to pass on three of them as explained above. 


## Disability, Religious, and Family Accomodations

If you have any need and/or questions about disability or religious accommodations, please refer to university policies regarding [disability accommodations](http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/current-students/accommodations/) or [religious accommodations](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-polic/) and feel free to contact me. For any family accomodations (e.g., child care), please do not hesitate to contact me so that we can work something out.  


## Original Work Policy and Plagiarism  


Plagiarism is the use of another person’s words or ideas without attribution to their source. In American intellectual culture, this is considered a form of cheating, dishonesty, and/or theft. At the University of Washington and in professional settings generally, plagiarism is an extremely serious matter.

In your writing for this course (and in most professional settings), please paraphrase whenever possible. This helps you process and understand what you have read. If truly necessary, you can quote published work, but quotations must be clearly marked and properly attributed. You may obtain copy editing assistance, and you may discuss your ideas with others — but all substantive writing and ideas must be your own or else be explicitly attributed to another, using a citation. The exact form of the citation is not important; what matters is that you provide sufficient detail for someone else to easily relocate your source, even years later (so URLs alone are insufficient).

All cases of plagiarism will be reported immediately. There will be no warnings, no second chances, no opportunity to rewrite. Consequences can range from failing the assignment (a grade of zero) or failing the course to expulsion from the University. If you have the slightest doubt about whether you are using the words or ideas of others appropriately, please ask.
